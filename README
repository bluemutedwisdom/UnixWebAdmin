A simple dancer WebApp to manage a unix server
allows managing users, groups, simple proccess managment, and simple file system operations
all this is currently being done without any system commands and using perl only
so it should be pretty easier to move between unix/linux distros

this is created for my unix course project in Afeka College
there are still rough edges and future improvments if i will get the them might include:
	changing the codebase to OOP (with Moose)
	adding better error handling
	making the templates looking better
	using ajax instead of loading the pages again and again
	etc
